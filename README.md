# Auth0Example

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.4.

## How to reproduce the error

- git clone <git_project_url> && cd auth0-example
- npm install
- ng serve && and open http://localhost:4200 (it works)
- ng server --prod (Look like it works, but the lock never catch the callback...)
